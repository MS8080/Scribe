# Quick Start Guide

Get MarkView up and running in 5 minutes!

## Step 1: Open the Project

```bash
cd /Users/ms/Documents/GitHub/MarkView
open MarkView.xcodeproj
```

## Step 2: Wait for Dependencies

When Xcode opens, it will automatically:
- Resolve the MarkdownUI package dependency
- Download the required Swift packages
- Index the project files

This usually takes 30-60 seconds.

## Step 3: Build and Run

1. In Xcode, ensure "MarkView" scheme is selected
2. Select "My Mac" as the run destination
3. Press `Cmd+R` or click the Play button
4. The app will build and launch

## Step 4: Test the App

### Create a New Document

### Interactive Checkboxes

### Build errors
